## If you see this I don't care I just made this copy for myself hell bitch

In my case I have 1366x768 monitor so I cannot see the keybind cheastsheets that he provided.

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Rubik 9'
```
Basically, this will do font adjustment in GNOME topbars (idk if that's waybar that we see just around top lol).

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Rubik 11'
```
Just go back if u don't like it lol just use Rubik and nothing else.

Just in case if I forgot to figure my right click in touchpad shit.
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad click-method 'areas'
```
