## lesson learn about dotfiles

- I do note that upgrading dotfiles is not necessary so I'm just here to wait for the newest coolest features that author has ever made.
- My Screen sharing is still unstable in my case like (Google Meet and Zoom)
- To be honest, I recommend that when upgrading the dotfile just do upgrade your packages instead I mean whole system except for the dotfile you're using unless you feel good upon the latest release btw.
- In short, if this dotfile become unmaintained forever then I will just wait for the final rest and u should live happy.
- Choose AMD / Intel in your life I'm still not happy with NVIDIA.
- Just aesthetic.
