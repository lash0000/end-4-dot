My favorite hyprland dotfiles and my favorite commit changes so far like it works at all this is AWESOME.

If you see this then this is not the right thing for you this is only available to EndeavorOS and Arch based distros.

## Note to reader:

- There are two .config folders please make it separate in order to work `install.sh` perfectly.
- I just made this copy for myself apply it with your taste.

For now, I don't have the following:
